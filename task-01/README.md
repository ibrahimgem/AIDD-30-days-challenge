# AI-Driven Development - 30-Day Challenge Task-1

**Question 1.** What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?

**Answer** AI-Driven Development means teaming up with Artificial Intelligence during software creation to save massive development time. Developers give the specs as instructions, and the AI quickly generates code, suggestions, and solutions—making the whole process faster and more efficient while humans stay in control.

**Question 2.** How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

**Answer** I see Human–AI collaboration speeding up software development dramatically. Humans will take the role of architects and evaluators, while AI handles most of the coding work. Instead of remembering syntax or functions, developers will provide clear specifications as prompts, and AI systems will turn them into production ready code shrinking development cycles from months to days.

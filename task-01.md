# What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?

AI-Driven Development is teamup with Artificial Intelligence while working on any software development and savings millions of minutes in development phase. By AI-Driven Development humans just pass specs as instructions to AI and AI will work on it in microseconds.

# How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

I see the Human-AI collabration can fast the software development from 10x to 100x by changing the role of human as architect / evaluator and AI as a pro coder. So no need to remember syntax and functions. Human will pass the specs as prompts which will work as instructions for AI, with that method software development phase will be shorten to days instead of months.

# AI-Driven Development - 30-Day Challenge Task-7



## What is SPECKit Plus?  
SPECKit Plus is a toolkit by Panaversity for AI-native software development. It is an executable documentation bundle that defines the rules, requirements, workflows, and test plans for an AI partner. Its purpose is to guide the AI to produce consistent, predictable, and high-quality outputs during development.

## Core concepts of SPECKit Plus
These are the 5 core concepts:

### 1. /constitution  
/constitution is a directory of rules which should be considered during development phase. It can be written once in a project and will be constant throughout the development lifecycle. Constitution defines project-wide quality standards.

### 2. /specify
/specify is the executable section where all project requirements, features, constraints, and details are written clearly. This is the place where vague ideas turn into precise specifications that guide the AI. Strong specifications matter more than code because they determine the quality of the final output.

### 3. /plan  
/plan is the high-level development roadmap that tells the AI what to build first, next, and last. It defines milestones, feature order, and the overall strategy for executing the project in a structured way.

### 4. /tasks  
/tasks is the section where the AI’s work is broken into actionable steps. Each task is specific, executable, and ensures the AI produces predictable and consistent results.

### 5. /implement 
/implement is the section that guides the AI on exactly how to perform each task, including error handling, output formatting, and other execution details, ensuring consistent and predictable results.
